Produce a C# Console App code to generate two linked datasets with synthetic data, 100+ entries each using Bogus.
Test data should be stored in separate files in CSV format. 
The generated test data should consist of two relations with the next structure and relationships: 
titles.id numeric title identifier
titles.title textual movie (series) name
titles.description textual title description
titles.release_year should have a Common Era year format
titles.age_certification should be one of these: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA
titles.runtime should be a common title duration in minutes
titles.genres should contain a list of strings representing various movie (series) genres
titles.production_country should represent a country in ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code
titles.seasons should represent the number of seasons for series or be empty for movies
credits.id numeric credits identifier
credits.title_id corresponding title id
credits.real_name full credits member name
credits.character_name corresponding movie (series) character name
credits.role should represent corresponding role and be one of these: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer

Here is a sample C# console application code to generate the two linked datasets as described, using Bogus:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using Bogus;
using CsvHelper;

public class Title
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
    public string AgeCertification { get; set; }
    public int Runtime { get; set; }
    public string Genres { get; set; }
    public string ProductionCountry { get; set; }
    public string Seasons { get; set; }
}

public class Credit
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int TitleId { get; set; }
    public string RealName { get; set; }
    public string CharacterName { get; set; }
    public string Role { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var ageCertifications = new[] { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
        var roles = new[] { "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", "Costume Designer", "Music Composer" };

        var titleFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.IndexFaker)
            .RuleFor(t => t.Name, f => f.Lorem.Word())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Description, f => f.Lorem.Sentence())
            .RuleFor(t => t.ReleaseYear, f => f.Random.Int(1900, DateTime.Now.Year))
            .RuleFor(t => t.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(ageCertifications))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Runtime, f => f.Random.Int(60, 180))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Genres, f => f.Lorem.Words(f.Random.Int(1, 3)).Aggregate((a, b) => a + ", " + b))
            .RuleFor(t => t.ProductionCountry, f => f.Address.CountryCode())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Seasons, f => f.Random.Bool() ? "" : f.Random.Int(1, 10).ToString());

        var creditFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
            .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.IndexFaker)
            .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 99))
            .RuleFor(c => c.RealName, f => f.Person.FullName)
            .RuleFor(c => c.CharacterName, f => f.Lorem.Word())
            .RuleFor(c => c.Role, f => f.PickRandom(roles));

        var titles = titleFaker.Generate(100);
        var credits = creditFaker.Generate(100);

        WriteToCsv(titles, "titles.csv");

Can you show how WriteToCsv method should be written?
ChatGPT
Sure, you would need to use the CsvWriter class from the CsvHelper library to write the data to the CSV file. Here's how the WriteToCsv method might look:

csharp
Copy code
public static void WriteToCsv<T>(List<T> records, string path)
{
    using (var writer = new StreamWriter(path))
    using (var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
    {
        csv.WriteRecords(records);
    }
}
This method takes a list of records and a file path, and writes the records to a CSV file at the specified path. It opens a new StreamWriter to write to the file, and a new CsvWriter to write the records in CSV format. The CsvWriter.WriteRecords method writes the list of records to the CSV file.

You would call this method for both your titles and credits list, like so:

csharp
Copy code
WriteToCsv(titles, "titles.csv");
WriteToCsv(credits, "credits.csv");
This would create two separate CSV files, titles.csv and credits.csv, in the same directory as your executable, each containing the respective synthetic data.





User
Will these two data sets be linked by fields titles.id and credits.title_id? 
ChatGPT
Yes, these two datasets will be linked through the titles.id and credits.title_id fields.

In the example I provided, titleFaker is generating a sequence of unique IDs for each title with the line .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.IndexFaker). These will be 0 through 99 for a total of 100 titles.

creditFaker is generating a random title ID for each credit with the line .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 99)). These IDs will match the IDs of the generated titles, linking each credit to a title.

However, there are two things to note:

Since creditFaker is generating random title IDs, some titles may end up without any associated credits.
Also, some titles may have multiple associated credits since there's no check preventing creditFaker from generating the same title ID for multiple credits.
If you want each title to have exactly one credit and vice versa, you could use f.IndexFaker for the credits.title_id as well, but you'd have to ensure that the credits are generated in the same order as the titles.

You could also manually create the links by first generating the titles, then for each title generate one or more credits, using the title's ID for the credit's title_id. However, this would require a more complex data generation process.

How to store generated csv data in the solutions folder?
ChatGPT
When you specify just the filename (e.g., "titles.csv") as the path for the StreamWriter, it will create the file in the same directory as your application's executable.

However, if you want to save the CSV files in a different location, such as your solution's folder, you can do so by specifying a full or relative path.

Assuming your console app is running from bin/Debug or bin/Release (which is standard), you can use a relative path to place the files in the solution's root folder. Here's how you might do this:

csharp
Copy code
WriteToCsv(titles, @"..\..\..\titles.csv");
WriteToCsv(credits, @"..\..\..\credits.csv");
In this case, ..\..\.. refers to three directories up from where your app is running. So if your app is running from YourSolution\YourProject\bin\Debug, it will go up to YourSolution\.

Please note that this is based on the standard .NET project structure and your actual paths may vary based on your project setup. Also, you may need to adjust the path if you are running the application from a different location or in a different way.

If you want to ensure that your files are always saved in the correct location regardless of where the application is running from, you could use an absolute path, although this may not be as portable, as the absolute path on your machine is likely different than on another machine.
